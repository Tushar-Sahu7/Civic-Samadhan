# Feature Specification: Citizen Issue Management Platform "Civic Samadhan"

**Feature Branch**: `002-description-we-are`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are building a citizen issue management platform called \"Civic Samadhan\". üéØ Goal: Ensure every citizen issue is acknowledged, categorized, prioritized, and resolved transparently, while giving citizens confidence that their voices matter. üë• Users: - Citizens: Report and track civic issues. - Staff: Work on assigned issues. - Department Heads/Admins: Assign issues, monitor progress, and ensure accountability. ‚öñÔ∏è Problem it solves: Citizens feel unheard and issues often get lost. This platform ensures issues are either linked to existing ones (avoiding duplicates) or created as new, and then resolved systematically. --- ### Key User Journey **1. Issue Reporting** - Citizen submits an issue via app/web with text, photo, location. - Citizen can optionally select a department (Roads, Water, Waste, Electricity). - If the citizen doesn‚Äôt know ‚Üí AI suggests the department. - Instant confirmation + unique reference ID is shown. **2. Duplicate Detection** - AI checks if the complaint already exists in the system. - If found: Citizen is shown the existing issue ‚Üí their complaint is attached under it (avoiding duplication). - If not: A new issue is created. **3. Categorization & Prioritization** - AI analyzes the description + photo ‚Üí suggests a category (if user didn‚Äôt select). - Priority Score is calculated based on: 1. **Urgency** (Is it dangerous to life/property?) 2. **Impact** (How many people affected?) 3. **Duration** (How long has it existed?) 4. **Location sensitivity** (School, hospital, market areas get higher weight). 5. **Citizen votes/complaint frequency** (If many report same issue ‚Üí priority rises). - Citizen sees ‚ÄúThis issue has been marked Critical/High/Medium/Low priority‚Äù for transparency. **4. Assignment Workflow** - System notifies department head/admin. - Department head assigns issue to a staff member. - Staff gets deadline & instructions. **5. Issue Tracking (visible to citizen)** - **Acknowledged** ‚Üí Complaint received. - **Staff Assigned** ‚Üí Responsible staff assigned by department head. - **In Progress** ‚Üí Work is happening. - **Resolved** ‚Üí Completed, proof uploaded. **6. Citizen Updates & Feedback** - Citizen gets notifications at every stage. - Citizen can track issue on dashboard/map. - Citizen can confirm resolution or reopen if unsatisfied. **7. Transparency & Insights** - Map view with pins for issues in the area. - Filter by category, status, department. - Success metrics: avg. resolution time, number of duplicate merges avoided, top departments with resolved issues. --- ### Outcomes that matter - Citizens feel heard ‚Üí no duplicate complaint ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù - Faster resolution via priority scoring & department assignment. - Admins maintain accountability with clear tracking stages. - Trust built through transparent communication and proof of resolution. --- ### Prototype requirement Design a complete issue lifecycle prototype including: - Citizen flow (report ‚Üí duplicate check ‚Üí track progress ‚Üí feedback). - AI flow (category suggestion, duplicate detection, priority scoring). - Staff/Admin flow (assign, update, resolve). - Issue status tracker (Acknowledged ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved). - Transparency UI (map view, dashboards, notifications). Focus: Build emotional reassurance for citizens (‚Äúyour issue is acknowledged, not ignored‚Äù) while enabling operational efficiency for staff."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A citizen discovers a pothole on their daily commute, reports it through the Civic Samadhan app including a photo and location, and receives a confirmation with a tracking ID. The system, using AI, detects it's a new issue, categorizes it under "Roads", and assigns a "High" priority due to its location on a busy street. The citizen receives notifications as the issue is assigned to a staff member, work begins, and is finally resolved with a photo of the repaired road. The citizen then confirms the resolution, closing the issue.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a citizen is logged into the app, **When** they submit a new issue with all required fields (text, photo, location), **Then** they receive an instant confirmation with a unique reference ID.
2. **Given** an issue has been submitted, **When** the AI detects a similar existing issue, **Then** the citizen is notified and their complaint is linked to the existing issue.
3. **Given** a new issue is created, **When** the AI analyzes the issue, **Then** a priority score and category are assigned, and the relevant department head is notified.
4. **Given** an issue has been assigned to a staff member, **When** the staff member updates the status to "In Progress", **Then** the citizen who reported it receives a notification.
5. **Given** an issue is marked as "Resolved" with proof, **When** the citizen views the issue, **Then** they have the option to confirm the resolution or reopen the issue.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a citizen submits an issue with a poor quality or irrelevant photo?
- How does the system handle an issue report where the location data is inaccurate?
- What is the procedure if a department head does not assign an issue within a specified timeframe?
- How are conflicting priority scores from multiple citizen reports on the same issue handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
