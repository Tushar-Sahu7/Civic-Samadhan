# Feature Specification: Civic Engagement Platform - Civic Samadhan

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We are building Civic Samadhan, a modern SaaS-style civic engagement platform designed for citizens and municipalities of Jharkhand. The goal is to simplify how citizens report civic problems and how local government bodies track, prioritize, and resolve them. Who will use this? Citizens who want to report civic issues such as potholes, garbage, water supply failures, or streetlight outages. Municipal staff who need to view, manage, and resolve assigned complaints efficiently. Department managers who monitor staff productivity, prioritize issues, and review progress. Admins who oversee the entire system across multiple municipalities, track KPIs, and manage users. What problem does it solve? Today, reporting civic issues is fragmented, confusing, and time-consuming. Citizens don‚Äôt know which department to approach, follow-ups are difficult, and duplicate reports waste resources. Civic Samadhan solves this by creating one unified platform where: Citizens can report issues quickly with a photo, voice, or text. The system auto-detects the right department using AI. Duplicate issues are batched to avoid redundancy. Staff and managers get clear dashboards with priorities. Citizens can track their issue‚Äôs lifecycle transparently. How will they interact with it? A citizen opens the web or mobile app, logs in, and selects ‚ÄúReport an Issue.‚Äù They choose or type an issue category, upload a photo, add a description, and allow location access. AI categorizes and routes the complaint to the right department. If the issue already exists, the citizen is notified and can simply ‚ÄúJoin this Issue‚Äù with one click, linking it to their profile. They can then track the issue in My Complains ‚Üí (My Issues, Known Issues, Completed). Notifications update them on progress until resolution, after which they can provide feedback. Staff members see assigned issues, navigate to the location, resolve, and upload proof. Departments monitor performance, reassign tasks, and manage issue batches. Admins see cross-department KPIs, hotspots on heatmaps, and overall system productivity. What outcomes matter? For Citizens: Fast, transparent resolution, easy tracking, reduced frustration. For Staff: Clear instructions, minimized duplicate effort, performance tracking. For Departments: Better resource allocation, SLA compliance, citizen satisfaction. For Admins: Macro visibility of civic health, accountability, and data-driven decision-making. For the System itself: Scalability to multiple municipalities, AI-driven prioritization, reduced redundancy, and actionable insights from aggregated data. This should evolve as we learn: Which categories matter most to citizens. How departments differ in workflows. Where bottlenecks appear in real-world usage. How multilingual and offline support can improve accessibility in Jharkhand. Success looks like a system where: Citizens feel heard and empowered. Issues are resolved faster and more transparently. Departments and staff become more efficient. The government gets real-time visibility into civic problems across the state."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A citizen of Jharkhand encounters a civic issue (like a pothole). They open the Civic Samadhan app on their phone, report the issue by taking a photo and adding a short description, and submit it. The system automatically routes it to the correct municipal department. The citizen receives notifications as the issue is acknowledged, worked on, and finally resolved, and can track the status at any time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a citizen is logged into the app, **When** they submit a new issue with a photo and description, **Then** the issue is created in the system and assigned to the correct department, and the citizen sees it in their "My Issues" list.
2.  **Given** an issue has been submitted, **When** a municipal staff member updates its status, **Then** the citizen who reported it receives a notification.
3.  **Given** a citizen tries to report an issue that already exists at the same location, **When** they submit the report, **Then** the system notifies them of the duplicate and allows them to "Join" the existing issue.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens when a user tries to report an issue without network connectivity? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Offline support is mentioned as a future evolution, but initial behavior is not defined.]
-   How does the system handle a photo that is blurry or doesn't clearly show the issue? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: AI categorization might fail. Is there a manual fallback?]
-   What happens if a citizen reports an issue outside of a municipality's jurisdiction?
