# Tasks: Civic Samadhan Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-we-are-building/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T001 [P] Create backend project structure: `backend/src/models`, `backend/src/services`, `backend/src/api`, `backend/tests`
- [ ] T002 [P] Create frontend project structure: `frontend/src/pages`, `frontend/src/services`, `frontend/tests`, `frontend/src/ui`
- [ ] T003 [P] Create services project structure: `services/ai-classifier`, `services/notification-service`
- [ ] T004 [P] Initialize Node.js project in `backend` with Express and TypeScript.
- [ ] T005 [P] Initialize React project in `frontend` with Vite.
- [ ] T006 [P] Sync UI components from Subframe into `frontend/src/ui` using the Subframe CLI.
- [ ] T007 [P] Initialize Python project in `services/ai-classifier` with Flask/FastAPI.
- [ ] T008 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools for all projects.

## Phase 2: Backend Development (Tests First)

### Contract Tests
- [ ] T009 [P] Write failing contract test for `POST /api/complaints` in `backend/tests/contract/test_complaints_post.ts`.

### Core Implementation
- [ ] T010 [P] Implement User model in `backend/src/models/user.ts`.
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement Department model in `backend/src/models/department.ts`.
- [ ] T012 [P] Implement Complaint model in `backend/src/models/complaint.ts`.
- [ ] T013 [P] Implement Issue model in `backend/src/models/issue.ts`.
- [ ] T014 Implement `POST /api/complaints` endpoint in `backend/src/api/complaints.ts`.
- [ ] T015 Implement service logic for processing complaints in `backend/src/services/complaint_service.ts`.
- [ ] T016 Implement database connection in `backend/src/services/database.ts`.
- [ ] T017 Implement authentication middleware in `backend/src/api/middleware/auth.ts`.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] T018 [P] Assemble the user login and registration forms in `frontend/src/pages/Auth.tsx` by importing and using components from `frontend/src/ui`.
- [ ] T019 [P] Assemble the complaint submission form in `frontend/src/pages/ReportComplaint.tsx` by importing and using components from `frontend/src/ui`.
- [ ] T020 [P] Assemble the issue tracking dashboard in `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` by importing and using components from `frontend/src/ui`.
- [ ] T021 [P] Write integration tests for the pages created in Phase 3, verifying state and interaction logic.

## Phase 4: AI Service Development
- [ ] T022 [P] Implement the AI classification service in `services/ai-classifier/main.py`.
- [ ] T023 [P] Write tests for the AI service.

## Phase 5: Integration and Polish
- [ ] T024 Integrate backend with the AI service.
- [ ] T025 Set up structured logging for all services.
- [ ] T026 Write integration tests for the full complaint submission workflow.
- [ ] T027 [P] Dockerize all applications.
- [ ] T028 [P] Create Kubernetes deployment configurations.
- [ ] T029 Set up CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies
- T001-T008 (Setup) must be done first.
- T009 (Contract Test) must be done before T014.
- T010-T013 (Models) must be done before T014 and T015.
- Backend (Phase 2) and Frontend (Phase 3) can be developed in parallel.

## Parallel Execution Example
```
# Launch backend model creation in parallel:
Task: "Implement User model in backend/src/models/user.ts"
Task: "Implement Department model in backend/src/models/department.ts"
Task: "Implement Complaint model in backend/src/models/complaint.ts"
Task: "Implement Issue model in backend/src/models/issue.ts"
```
